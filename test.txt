This is a test document for the RAG application.

It contains some sample text that will be split into chunks and stored in the vector database.

The document ingestion process should parse this text, create embeddings, and store them in PostgreSQL with pgvector.

This allows for semantic search and retrieval when users ask questions about the content.
